Can't stay awake always tired and doesn't seem to work for me I've had up to 40mg need to try a different tablet,1
My doctor told me 50% of people feel an improvement in the first drug they take.",1
"No improvement after 3 months @ 40 mg.  TERRIBLE dry mouth, especially at night. I waken throughout night,'cuz my mouth feels like it's full of toxic glue, and I can't get it hydrated no matter what I try.  I'm titrating off starting today!",1
"I was on this for two years for depression/anxiety.  At first it worked, but I had to keep increasing my dose and finally it just quit working completely.  Not only was I JUST as depressed as before, but I also gained 25 pounds and can't lose any more than 5 pounds after having been off if for four months.  I do believe it has done something to my metabolism and really hope I can get my body to return to normal.  If I could go back in time, I would NEVER have gotten on this horrible drug.  I will never take an antidepressant again. ",1
Depression has greatly increased,1
"I've been told, by doctors through the years, that I've been depressed all my life and don't know it.  Was prescribed Wellbutrin but it seems I'm one of those rarer side effects.  Now, I have been prescribed 10mg of this at bedtime.  I also have low testosterone, adult ADD they say and high blood pressure.  I. Wondering if anyone has had similar prognosis and what they have done that worked?  I exercise regularly and eat decent.  dadtech@hotmail.com",1
"Too many side effects to warrant its use in my case, was slightly effective but my mild depression didnt warrant use of what I see as quite a powerful mind changing substance. It helped but at a cost.",1
makes me very tired and nauseated,1
"I was given this generic, actually two generics (both new to me) were mixed in one prescription container. I had been doing fine on another citalopram generic and am again now. But for the month of April I went from not crying at all while on the meds (a trade off I accepted) to crying every day and feeling extremely depressed. It was as if I was taking nothing at all. ",1
"They prescribed this drug because of the depression I experienced when my testosterone went low. I should have had the testosterone issue treated properly, but they insisted I used an ineffective testosterone gel. A year ago I found out that getting testosterone injections was far more effective and less expensive than androgen.  by then I was hooked on Celexa/Citalopram. I eventually weaned myself off of anti depressants, (thanks to medical mj which helped immensely, and I no longer need that) - but after 3 weeks off celexa, and my test levels normal, I had the biggest spiritual breakthru in my life. My gut feeling is BigPharma does not care about the condition of your soul, they just want to make money.  Anti depressants are only for people who absolutely need them or will die. I would do everything in my power to treat the real cause of depression, and not use an anti depressant. NEVER AGAIN for me. At age 58, my soul is finally free and I am back to normal and happy now",1
"Against my wishes, my pcp prescribed this to me because my mother wanted a quick fix instead of some therapy (@ age 17). It gave me worse depression symptoms; I could/would not go to school, antisocial, barely ate. When I got off of it, I went through a severe withdrawal consisting of cold sweats and rage for 2 weeks.",1
This medication doesn't work at all. ,1
"After taking this medication for only 7 days, my brother-in-law commited suicide.  He was a kind, gentle man who never talked of suicide, was dealing with health issues (gall bladder problems) and they put him on this medication because it was taking the stomach doctor so long to get him in to take care of his stomach issues.  He was a person who never would have even thought of hurting himself nor his family.  He had a loving wife, loving children and grandchildren.  They are now having to face losing him this way.  He was not monitored adequately by his treating physician who prescribed this medication.  The whole family knows that this drug made him see suicide as his only way for relief from his frustrations.  Please, please, do not take this medication under any circumstances unless you are confined to a hospital or clinic where you can be monitored 24 hours a day!!!",1
i couldnt get past the first day of it  going to try someting else ",1
i took this medication and within about 2 or 3 days i was gaining bounds of weight and shaking so violently i could not write. by the 4 week mark when there was absolutely no change in my depression i quit and refused to take depression meds anymore. i would prefer to be miserable than have horrible side effect AND be miserable,1
"I was taking lexapro but stopped due to expense and loss of insurance.I have been taking Celxa for 5 months.I feel more depressed,irritable and no energy.I now feel I need to try another medication.",1
Used for 30 days didn't see any results.  Made me extremely tired during the day.  Would have to take a nap during the day most days.,1
I do not have very much energy and have sleep problems,1
"Prescribed for depression and anxiety. Seemed to help with anxiety, not with depression. Sexual side effects. Horrible withdrawal symptoms when stopped.",1
I just started on this medication,1
"My doctor put me on 20ml of this with phentermine so I can lose the 20 pounds I have gained.  After reading how these two drugs should not be taken together, it scared the crap out of me so I will stop it and only continue with the phentermine.  Why would a doctor put me on two drugs that should not be used together?",1
very weak,1
My P.C.P., the following day, sent me to E.R. at one of our illustrious hospitals here at the Medical Center, Houston. This was the same hospital that put me on this ""Coctail"" to begin with while I was being treated there for 6 1/2 days.I was given Rx's upon release. 7 days later, while at home, I fainted twice in a 8 hour period. Upon release, the second time, I was told to stop taking the ""Tramadol"". In my own opinion, after extensive research on web sites as this one, WebMD, I stopped taking, not only Tramadol, but also Cymbalta and Citalpram - the drug, that in my opinion, caused these serious side effects and could have killed me !",1
Very bad results. First two months was great. Chronic pain subsided. Then went into deepening depression.,1
,1
"Bad reaction. First dose of 20mg Citalopram caused heart palpitations, tremors, and increased anxiety. Took as directed, after food in the morning.",1
very tired can't seem to sleep at night but can sleep in the day after a few days of staying up for two or three days at a time but i do feel a little calmer..,1
"My dr put me on citalopram to help with my depression.  At first, it worked ok and didn't have any side effects.  Yet, after a year of being on this medication, I have noticed that I don't enjoy anything in my life and all of my relationships are slowly deteriorating.  This medication has also made me extremely tired, lose focus at work, and gain over 40 lbs in the past year-this is very uncharcteristic since I only gained about 1 to 2 lbs a year before taking Citalopram.  After a major spell of depression while being on citalopram, I decided to ask my doctor to change my medication. I am now taking Wellbutrin for only 2 days so far and already feel better and more hopeful about life(dr. said Wellbutrin is an NDRI which affects the brain differently than SSRI meds like Citalopram).  I hope the Wellbutrin works.",1

"No effect after this huge expense.  Took for 30 days; no effect. On Citalopram. Absolutely no positive effect,although I am experience brief, mid-day waves of depression, unknown heretofore.  Not a Happy Camper....!76WM",1
"sill not sleeping,still moody",1
"I started this med 4 wks. ago @ 10 MG/day. After a few days I felt a calming effect. However, after 1 week I could no longer reach an orgasim & my sleep was horrible. In additon, I was tired much of the time. I have decided to not take anymore anti depressants as most all of them have sexual side effects. I am not that depressed & have managed for 60 yrs. I probably should not have started these meds. I have not met anyone who had anything good to say about these drugs. I do not know anyone who was severely depressed. Can I stop taking my 10 MG all at once or do I have to cut down to 5 MG 1st? ",1
"I started this medication 4 weeks ago on 20mg. Today I don't know if it is the meds but I had some energy. I started cleaning everything but at the same time felt tired. The Doctor is going to up the dosage do you think this well help. I have severe depression,anxiety and A.D.D",1
this mediciand has made me more down then i was at first plus gave me real bad headackes the day after. did not like this feeling at all.,1
"This medication gave me terrible side effects; I stopped eating, threw up daily, it made me dizzy, kept me awake at night, and I would shake constantly. The side effects were not worth what the drug could potentially do for me.",1
I haven't seen any differents I'm still feel down and find myself crying at work and home. ,1
"Switched from Cymbalta to this (because of cost), but it did not control my depression the way Cymbalta did.  It took a while to figure out, because the symptoms did not manifest in the way I was used to (was more angry and irritable than sad and weepy).  Also allowed my fibromyalgia pain to get way out of control too.",1
"it dropped my blood sugar, i have never had sugar issues in my life. i only wiegh 105lbs. i now have to take insulin shots.it sent me to the emergency room with a bloodsugar of 650 thats coma state for some .",1
this drug was a very bad experience and I dont recomend it to anyone. the risks far out balance the benifits, as it even began to affect my liver funtion and vision. there are many more drugs out there that do a better job than this with far less serious risks, after being hospilized due to this drug, I was shocked to read the list of side effects, and even 2 weeks in, I was experiencing common and uncommon side effects, who knows what would have happened if I were to remain on it. I can not recomend this drug for anyone taking Concerta while on this drug or trying to replace Paxil WITH this drug.",1

too many side effects,1
"I have been taking this drug for nearly a year and it puts a thin veneer of civilization between other people and myself.  I have fatigue, mood swings, excessive weight gain, brittle nails and cannot stand to be around people more than an hour at a time.  I am depressed and wish people would just disappear off the face of the planet so I do not have to deal with them.  When will there ever be a real drug to treat depression??",1
"I was on this medicine for 6 to 7 months, in the beginning I needed this medicine for depression at 40mg for the first 2 weeks, changes on my mood have been occuring negativly, no sleep, trouble concentrating, etc. I contacted my doctor, and he said to ""give it more time"", so I did. A month later I went from a 137ibs to 152ibs so I contacted my doctor he said this medication does not make you gain weight, he said it was my diet. With total weight gain I went from 137ibs to 175ibs. After reading some of the comments at WebMD I found out that this medication DOES make you gain weight. I stopped taking the medicine cold turkey, I am back on my old medication and my weight is starting to come down. After leaving this medication, I had no more bad ideas but sometimes, I cannot control my eyes, they twitch from one side to the other for a second and it happens when im driving. I dont know if it is some kind of withdraw side effect from the medicine and if this is happened to someone else, PLEASE post a comment, I will be checking regularly.",1
"Taking for a week.  No effect on mood though I understand it takes some time so I will stick with it.  Nausea, restless sleep, sweats, and lots of yawning during the day.  First AD ever taken so I really hope it works.  ",1

"I have been on this for 2 weeks half 20mg pill and have no energy, strange dreams at night, more depressed. It does make my mood swings better but I find that I don't really care about anything when I'm on it. The stomach aches are really bad on it. I will try it for 2 months and see what happens. So far nothing is happening on it. ",1
"I feel like this medication isn't helping me at all, just making me very nervous.",1
"I started taking this medication to counteract depression, only to find that it made it worse. I felt extremely weak and dizzy. Try something else.",1
"I have been on this for 1 year. In the beginning seemed to work well. Now I am awake during the night, have absolutely no energy during the day. Andwhat used to be a very active sex life has now vanished.",1
When I started taking the drug it helped but over a peroid of time my depression got worse.  I am now taking Zoloft and it is an execllent drug for my symptoms.   ,1
",1
i have been taking citalopram for over a year.it hasnt helped and i have gotten worse i finally told my doctor and she recently switched me to prozac. when on citalopram my anger was bad temper short and got angry for no reason i have put on over 40 lbs and i just didnt need that. i hope this new med works because i am feeling tired and suicidal all the time i just sit in my room and cry i have to hide this from my daughter because she is a natural worrier. she is the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end so if you are taking citalopram watch out for more depression good luck,1

"I had a mild allergic reaction to this drug.  It was my first experience taking an antidepressant and I ended up in the ER!  Nothing major - my throat felt tight (but was not closing up) and my chest felt a little tight too.  The ER gave me benadryll and let me sleep off the symptoms, and I was fine.  The doctors were very surprised I had a reaction to that; they cannot figure out why.  I have eczema, which they said may have somehow contributed but I have no other medication or food allergies.",1
"This pill is NOT working for me and if you change from one anti-depressant to another, be careful!",1

"I was put on 10 mg of this drug, meaning to increase to 20 after a week (it was to be taken right before bedtime because of drowsiness).  I stopped taking it after 5 days.  I was prescribed this medication in order to combat grief symptoms and anxiety after the death of both of my parents.  I had high hopes, as I had never been on an anti-depressant and was hoping this might make me feel like ""me"" again so that I could do everyday activities without getting stressed and exhausted.  It did improve my quality of sleep and I woke up refreshed and energized, but I would ""crash"" later in the day, a few hours before I was to take my next dose.  It was how I imagine a drug user's ""highs"" and ""lows"" to be, on a milder level.  I had compulsive suicidal thoughts on this medication, and because of this I probably should have told someone I was taking it (I meant for my use of this drug to be private).  Nothing I would act on, but the compulsive thoughts were there.  After having one, I remember thinking to myself, ""woah, I can't believe I just thought that.""  I was almost more anxious on this med and the boomerang effect on my mood was just too much.  May work for some, but not for my particular case.",2

"I have beenhaving excessive sweating and urination from taking this medication, As soon as I saw the side effects I told my Doctor to take me off it.  Also muscle and joint pain is something I don'y need with Fibromyalgia.",2
My son was taking Effexor XR 150mg but got into the donut hole for my coverage and cannot afford to pay $135.00 a month so my dr. switched me to Citalopram 10 mg- was not working-is that the correct amount that I should be taking?,2
3 weeks and still feel foggy.does it take longer to work?,2
I have been on this medication for nearly a month and I feel no different then I did..I am now taking 20 mg at bed time...And all the symptoms I had originally are still there...I'm moddy ...filled wit rage or sad/depressed/over whelmed all the time...The only thing I am geting from this is Tired all the time...So far I wouldn't recommend it.,2
I found my issue becoming worse so I stop taking it and still looking for the drug to help with depression. Everyday life is very hard for me and I hope I can find that right one.,2
"I've been on this drug(20mg) for 6months + and I don't like it. It has made all my symptoms worse. I either can't sleep or sleep too much, my weight is like a yo-yo, my moods are all over the placer and so is my mind; my thoughts are incredibly scattered and disorganised, and my paranoia has not shifted. Unfortunetely I was allergic to Fluxotine.",2

I started to have dreams and night sweats. I have never had dreams before so it is making me confused. lost of lebito, which is not good for my marriage at all. I plan on give it another week then try to get something else a try. ",2
"Of course, taking any new med, it takes time to get used to it; however, I've waited a long time to ""get used"" to it. It makes me dizzy, always sleepy and extremely irritable. I don't feel like myself. It's an off and on feeling. So after 3 months of this drug, I'm going to seek something new.",2
"i got on this med because my fluoxetine stoppped working. after 2 weeks of taking this i had a slump, i didn't geet out of bed for 2 days. even now after 4 weeks i still get naseous after i take it,with previous meds the nasea subsided after a week or so. also 2 weeks into taking it i was unable to have an orgasm. my insomnia is worse now then when i was off meds.i am groggy and in a daze most of the time. i can't get my work done at my job.so bacically i can't eat, i can't sleep, sex is useless, i am more frustrated and depressed then when my last meds stopped working. i'm misserable. i told my dr how the meds were(not) working and was told give it 2 more weeks now after that 2 weeks i have to wait a week to get in to see her. blah ",2

"Ive been taking this medication for a year now and it has helped me in so many ways. I take the 20mg. it took probably about two weeks before i noticed anything different. My family noticed an improvement in my mood the first week. I can wake up in the moring and not feel dread and i can control all my emotions so much better. I dont cry on a drop of a dime anymore. I actually laugh and it feels amazing. This medicine has changed my life. The only thing i get as a sideeffect is the constant yawning, but ive grown accustomed to it. Thank you citalopram.",5
I had taken Citalopram years ago and thought it was replaced as most meds are but I have been on it for a little while(2 weeks) and I already feel better which is great because the medicine I was on made my depression worse.My depression went from a 9 to a 5 on citalopram and I never thought I would get down to a 5 again.,5
"Never really thought it was depression, but maybe it was. Life was just too hard. This medication works very well, and I can usually tell if I miss a dose. Before I took this I wanted to have more intimate and sexual relations with husband. Downside is not caring if I have sex or not.",5
At first I was reluctant to take Citalopram, but I know I needed that extra bit of help. It's not a magic wand, or a wonder drug, but it has helped me to help myself.",5
"Have found that I need to carefully balance the use of this medication with my need for it.  If I take too large of a dose I end of tired and unfocused.  I end up cutting the pills to a 1mg dose and at that level I can tolerate the side effects and still benefit from the drug.  Unfortunately, even at this trivial dose I have a significant sexual side effect.  At times I've stopped the drug for months and the side effect still remains, I fear it may have become permanent.  Now I need to go back on the med, but I'm hesitant because I'm so worried about this side effect.",5
Started taking 20 mg in 1996. Up to 40 mg for 8 years. Had some really bad things happen in my life.  Went into a deep depression. Didn't seem like it was working anymore. Went to a psychiatrist who had me try over 12 different anti-depressants over 8 months. None of them worked for me. I ended up back on citalopram 60 mg which is working exceptionally well for me. It also helped me with all my anxiety. Can't say enough good things about this med. ,5
"taken along with abilify and lamectal, it has worked well",5
"This medication has changed my life. It has worked wonders for me. With any medication there are side effects. I am so anti medication and tried herbal or alternative medication. However with severe anxiety and depression this medication has helped me get back on track in life. I was very anxious about taking the medication but now I am taking it I wish I'd done it sooner. You do need to be patient to see results and also tolerate the side effects because in the long run the benefit of this medicine outweighs the minor side effects. It works for me but maybe not for everyone, however it's worth a try as doctors wouldn't prescribe something without benefiting you and making you better.",5
taking in conjunction with abilify and and lamectal I have never felt better.  I rate this medication an A.  Hope others have the same luch,5
"I've had a chemical imbalance my entire life and mental illness runs on both sides of my family. This is the only medication that has ever helped take the edge off of the emotional roller coaster called ""life"". I've tried other things and this has helped me relax and look at the big picture. Thank God for this medicine and the doctors who created it to help people like me. I feel normal and happy and worry less. ",5

"I have been on this medication for five years now for the treatment of depression and anxiety. I absolutely love it, as it allows me to be fully myself. I would highly recommend this to anyone suffering from depression or anxiety.",5
I am more tolerant of others and they are of me as well as long as I am on this medication.  I have gained ALOT of weight since starting this but I am still happier.  Started with 20mg but 40mg is what i have been on for years now and I definitely have a better outlook on life.,5
This medication has helped me resolve my depression and some anxiety issues,5
"Starting taking this drug after heart bypass surgery in 2012. I was diagnosed with depression after the surgery, apparently it is rather common especially in men after a major event such as surgery. It took a while, but is has been helping. Hopefully I wont have to continue taking it for the rest of my life",5
"When I first started taking citalopram, I had dry mouth and night sweats, but those side effects weren't too bad. Within about 2weeks I noticed that I was smiling more-even when I wasn't necessarily happy. Citalopram has most definitely increased my quality of life. I may not always be happy, but I enjoy life more. I get out more and actually participate in life. I was on 40mg for a few years and have now been on 20mg for ~a month bc I'm trying to titrate down as I may be trying to conceive in a few months. I have had some withdrawal symptoms such as ""brain zaps"" which sounds scarier than they really are. I notice my sadness and irritability more, but I'm pretty laser-focused on trying to get pregnant soon. So I'm toughing it out. I am a bit frightened to not take it at all, but I'll be sure to talk about this with my M.D.",5

Maybe I should stick with this sleeping problem than risk all of those seemingly commonly experienced side effects.",5
This drug had a significant positive impact on my life.  There were many minor side affects at first but the went away for the most part.,5
"Been on citalopram first 20mg then up to 40mg then 60mg hen recalled the maximum dosage so I've been on 40mg a day since. I can honestly say it's changed my life for the better. However, have you missed a day or so's dosage by mistake?! Omg dreadful feeling!!! And apparently it's not addictive!!! Yeah ok then :/ ",5

"I am smiling more often, much more happy, and less negative feeling towards life.",5
For people just starting to take Celexa (or Citalopram), I suggest starting with no more than 10 mg in the morning. Don't take it at night! The side effects I experienced by starting off with 20 mg at night might not have been caused by the medication (according to my doctor), but I suggest that you take no chances: start in the morning with or after breakfast. Keep in mind that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and it is NOT a train coming at you!",5

have been on different MEDS for 20 years because of clinical depression and this one workes well  for me,5
I was terribly sad living with my adult daughter in her home and working in her office.  She became increasingly irritated with me and fresh with her mouth.  I cried to my doctor and she recommended citalipram. This  medication helped me very much deal with the sadness I was feeling and I eventually moved out of her home...  ,5
"I'm 17 and this was my first antidepressant. I suffer a severe depression, minor anxiety, and compulsive skin picking. In the first month the suicidal thoughts were the worse they've ever been, (I told my mom this and I was monitored so nothing rash was done) but I'm hitting my second month now and it's not so bad. It has helped ten-fold with the depression and anxiety, however it has made my skin picking dramatically worse. For me, that's not too bad to deal with because my skin picking was  never in dangerous places and it never really scarred bad. The side effects are also minimal.",5
"I have suffered from PTSD for many years. After so long of suffering, I decided to go ahead and give the medicine a try.  Citalopram has definitely made a difference in my life. I felt like a whole new person. Starting off I had a tad bit of a headache, tight jaw, and dry mouth. It lasted about 3 days, that was it. I was moved up slowly therefore I did not experience any bad side effects as starting at a high dose will cause.  I would really recommend citalopram. Everyone around me says how much of a happier person I am, and I am not as afraid of being in crowds as I was before. Very life changing. It feels great not to feel angry, depressed, scared anymore like before.  I am now at 40mg and have been on it for 4 years.",5

I haven't decided if it's worth trying a new medicine for that reason yet, since I'm so happy with it otherwise.",5

One by one the symptoms started to disappear.  I feel I can see past today, care about tomorrow. Is everything coming up roses, no, but I can handle everyday life.  I can see the joy of being here and appreciate life.  It was hard going to the doctor to ask for help, but this drug was defintely worth it. Thats what you have to do when your depressed reach out and ask for help. I am so glad I did.",5

Since my mother was chronically depressed her whole life and so was her mother I decided to stay on the drug and lower the dose to 10mg/day.  Eureka!  Smoothed out my emotions and lets me feel normal. I have a low tolerance for drugs so this seems to be a more than adequate dosage to alleviate my symptons.  Less can be more. I have been taking this for over 5 years and I am just starting to have sweating and insomnia issues that are not menopausal. I shower more and read alot to get sleepy.  I have had problems with rashes when I don't hydrate effectively and wear poyester clothing. Easy fix, drink more, wear cotton and stay cool. Overall this drug does the job that Zoloft couldn't. ",5

On a second note, my daughter (26) began taking this for anxiety - 20 mg twice per day. It caused the shakes to start out with which went away, but then her hands, wrists, ankles and lips swelled up. It was the citalopram which caused these problems. So, two different results within our same family. She would probably tell you to stay away from it. I say it works perfectly, but please be careful.

"I've been taking this medication for about 7 months now. I love it! I was depressed, angry and withdrawn from everyone around me and would bite someones head off without any provocation. I also worried about every little thing. After taking it for a month I started to feel better and mellowed. It's hard to get me angry now and the depression is gone and I don't worry about much of anything. Have gained 10 lbs recently but started working out and lost most of it and feel better too! Weight gain is only an issue if you let it be and choose to sit around and not work out and eat healthy. Can't reach a climax very easily, but solved my pme problem and that's a good side effect for me! There is no shame in taking it, I put it off for too long and regret it now. Life is so much better and everyone can stand to be around me again and I them. I've found I'm actually a fun person since taking this. Just take it! Wake up in the morning, take the pill and forget about it. Only warning I have is, take it everyday! If you don't you and everyone around you will know that your not on it! After a couple days without due to forgetting to take with me on vacation, I was back to my old self in full force. Don't let all the discouraging comments on this site sway you. Try it for a couple months and see what happens, if  you like it keep it, if not then try something else. But you have to give it time, it will not work over night! A month and a week was how long it took for me. Yeah I could feel something after two weeks but really noticed and started getting comments on my attitude after a month. ",5

I take it around 8pm, sleep like a log and am refreshed upon waking.   Have lost 4 pounds which I didn't need to lose.  I took Zoloft years ago and it made me a zombie and gained 15 pounds on it.

This drug has made me feel a lot better.  Have problems with depression and also agitation/anger issues.  Since I have been taking this medication I don't fly off the handle like I use to and I don't just sit around in a blah state of mind. I take it at night because it does make me sleepy but I had rather deal with being sleepy than snapping at my loved ones in anger and being depressed.  Also before I started this medication I constantly woke up every 2 or 3 hours and I could never remember my dreams but now I sleep through the night and I can remember my dreams. My dreams are really random and vivid.  Overall I feel much better especially when I go to bed at a reasonable hour and get plenty of sleep.

"I have tried other AD and while some worked they had side affects that I could not live with, one made me vomit almost every night. My doctor decided to try Citalopram and I am so glad. I still feel like me but my emotions do not get out of control. My depression seems under control. I have had no side effects and do not feel numb like I did on other AD's.",5
"I started feeling better very quickly.  This drug puts a ""floor"" in my emotions where there had previously been none.  I can still feel — I still get sad and cry, which I'm happy about.  But it's just regular sadness now.  It doesn't plummet me.  I'm more interested in sex than I used to be, and it feels better too.  But my ability to focus has been slightly impaired, and I yawn a whole lot now.  ",5

"When i first started I had some moderate side effects- nausea, head ache, decreased appetite and low sex drive. Everything cleared up within 2 weeks. Now the only side affect is night sweats. Other than that its very effective for helping my depression and anxiety. ",5
",5
this drug worked for me in 2 hours.  it was life changing.  Additional side effects i have that are not mentioned in the literature:  clenching teeth and less deep sleep.,5

"This has been a wonderdrug for me! Took 6 weeks, but has been amazing. Give it time to work! ",5
"I took Effexor XR in high school for depression, but unfortunately dealt with an emotional numbness, nightmares, and migraines on that medication and gave up on anti-depressants to pursue hobbies, etc...  About two years ago, the depression came back full force and I asked my doctor to try something new, so she prescribed Citalopram, a generic for Celexa.  It has kept me balanced out without making me feel numb or having any other unpleasant side effects.  Everybody's body chemistry is different, and although effexor didn't do it for me,  this medication keeps me in check beautifully.",5
"This drug took a bit more than two weeks for me to respond to it, but all in all it has been good.  I have had very few side effects-mostly I'm more tired, but that could have been other health issues that are ongoing.  I used lexapro before citalopram.  I like lexapro better but because lexapro stopped working I needed a new antidepressant and citalopram is just fine.  ",5
"After tring 3 other drugs, this was the one I could stick with.  I had probablems sleeping at first, but that was cured by taking OTC Melatonin.  I have put a few pounds on, but I think that has been do to my on-the-go mom lifestyle.  My libido actually increased.  My husband is a happy man, too.  I am less stressed, happy and the old me, again.",5
I have taken this med for 3+ years. Previously I was on another kind of anti-depressant which worked well except for the side affects.  This one has been good for me with no side affects except maybe being a little more tired.  I can cope with that.,5
"This med has dramatically improved my quality of life! Despite my loss of libido, it has been worth the sacrifice!",5
I have been taking this medicine for almost a mounth.At first I have side affects from it but was told they would pass .And they have . It is really working for me very well.,5
"I have been on this drug now for a year to treat a combination of depression and anxiety. Tried getting off it because of the weight gain and within a month started to change my mood drastically and had to go back on. Keeps my energy level up, otherwise I am very tired without it.",5
"I was first prescribed Lexapro,and that cause horrible heart palpitations and night sweats.  I was then switched to the citalopram, a very lose dose, it has been a God-send!  I feel so much better, and no heart issues, slight night sweats still, but dealable...dry mouth is very slight and water with lemon works for that.  I could go up in dose, but this is working for me and leaves room to change if needed in the future.",5
"I'm on a very low dose. More even keel, a bit more engergetic, better focused, calmer. Still a little down. Don't want to be a zombie (as with Zoloft) so I try to stay on the low dose and find balance in daily life. The drug has helped me a great deal.",5
I switched from prozac to citalopram and what a difference! I'm so glad my doctor knew to do this!!! It has turned my mental outlook a complete 180 degrees!,5
It keeps me at an even keel throughout the day.",5
"This medication has saved my life.  You really need to give it at least 2 months.  I had some of the side effects, but over all it was not as bad as I thought it was going to be.  ",5
I dont keep to myself as much and also seem to do more of my everyday activities as before I did not want to do anything.,5
I have tried over about 12 anti-depressants over 20 years and this is the only thing that has proven results for my depression.,5
"Citalopram saved my life! It took 6 weeks to see the effects, but I am glad I waited it out. I feel like myself again. Love it!",5
this was a wonderful drug it helped me out alot,5
"Citalopram works for my depression as well as controlling my anxiety.  I have no problems with nightmares, sleep and/or weight gain. Like other similar drugs (Paxil & Prozac) I had to 'up' my dose slowly to avoid headaches.  I now take 60 mg/day. ",5

"I have been on citalopram for 2 yrs and life is great seems ironic to be on an antidepressent.... tryed coming of it and evrything go back to how it was, worryed that it will stop me having kids....",5
"I AM DISABLED, AND I GET THE WINTER BLUES. IF IT GOES TILL END OF SPRING,START OF SUMMER I TOLD DOC AND GOT THIS. STARTED AT 10MG TWO WINTERS AGO NOW UP TWO 40MG. HELPS A TON.",5
"I've been on Citalopram for 2 weeks and I've been feeling great at work!! I'm able to get out of bed in the morning and start my day normally, I don't argue with anyone at work and I don't feel like chopping off someone's head!! This medicine has worked great so far. The only side affects I've notice are increased daily headaches, but my daily migraines have gotten a little better, just more frequent.",5
My first medicine for depression and I m a new woman. I felt after two weeks that a huge weight had lifted from my shoulders and I began to unwind like a coiled spring. I don't have any side effects . My life is beginning again.,5
"I started out on 10mg a day for the first week then up to 20mg the second week. The first three days I had a headache, dry mouth, and my jaw was clenching. It was tolerable. I now feel WONDERFUL! Better than I have in YEARS! I was a complete skeptic plus after reading some of the reviews I was a bit nervous to even start on meds. Well, I'm more energetic. I feel way better about myself no longer just wanting to be alone and cry. No longer feeling like a nervous wreck or having really bad anger. My sex drive has INCREASED! I do have a loss of appetite not too badly though. I still do have a bit of anxiety but citalopram has worked wonders on my depression. I'm still seeing a counselor so I'm sure in time with that it will go work out as well.",5
I'm taking this medication for PMS depression. It alleviated any depression that I was experiencing during PMS. ,5
I don't know whether or not this drug will have the same effect on you as it does me, but if you are having depression symptoms I have two pieces of advice for you:  1) don't stop trying different medications until you have found the one or ones that works best for you; 2) try citalopram.  ",5
"I have used this for a few years.  I don't feel as stressed out, and I can focus more.  No sexual side effects.  Tried to get off it a couple of times and experienced extreme side effects.  When you take a pill you feel better within a couple hours. That's my only concern.",5
"Works great.  Dizzy spells, blurry vision and tiredness happened during the first 2 weeks but after getting through those 2 weeks everything is great.  It helps me with my depression and keeps me calm during stressful situations.  Normally when I would be stressing out this drug keeps me calm, cool and collected.  The only side effect I have now is a decreased sex drive.  ",5
"The citalopram worked perfectly for me. You didn't have any ""lingering"" effects during the day to cause you to feel drugged or detached. The only side effect for me was a sexual side effect. Very frustrating! Would recommend use (even with side effect) for treatment of depression/anxiety.",5

"I have taken this medication for approximately 2 years.  The first few weeks were challenging as I was thirsty and VERY tired.  This went away after approximately 2 weeks and I felt a greater sense of calm and more like myself.  I am currently tapering my dose as I would like to become pregnant again but am experiencing a kind of dizziness or ""trails"" to my vision.  I am waiting for this to end -hopefully soon!",5
I have felt tons better taking this drug,5
I had been on effexor for years and it no longer worked for me.  This medication saved my life and my sanity.,5
my overall experience has been wonderful. the only side effect that i have noticed is dry mouth.,5
I had  moderate depression and in three days I experienced lifting of the depression. I take 20 mg and have had not side effects,5
"Been taking this drug for 9 yrs. I'm back to myself. Emotionally stable, positive, happy person. Give it a chance if not try something else your MD recommends, don't give up there is something out there for you!",5
"Give the meds time to work and trust your psychiatrist! It took a few weeks and adjusting the meds (I'm on 30 mg), but I am completely back to normal. I was scared to death to try this med, but now I am perfectly fine.  I can sleep, eat, and be happy again!! DO NOT listen to the comments from patients who have been on citalopram under two weeks. It is medically proven to TAKE TIME. It doesn't work in one to two days!",5
"First day taking citalopram. Really helped to calm my anxiety. Slight spaced out feeling and minor difficulty with focusing. Aside from those, no real side effects. So far so good. Will update soon.",5
"Taking for PMS.. Very happy with the effectivensee, However I have gain about 15- 20lbs... Not from eating! I work out every day.. Not sure if I should go off or not... I don't want to feel moody but I also don't want to be FAT!!!",5
It took about 4 weeks but what a difference i would not have believed it if i did not try it.,5
This medicine has helped me to get my life back. I had severe depression and mood swings before taking this. I was unable to consentrate and remember simple things. There has been a major difference in my thinking since I have started taking Citalopram. I feel like a better person.,5
I have noticed that my overall attitude has changed not to mention my anxiety is managed.  At times I do feel like my brain is working faster than I can but overall I am extremely happy.,5
